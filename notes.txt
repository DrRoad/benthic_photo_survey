Camera setup:

Make sure the cameras date and time are correctly set to local time before taking photos. On the Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS4, you have to take it out of iA mode (put it in P mode for example), go to the settings menu, and turn on Auto Clock Set. This should sync the camera's clock with the gps time. If you're using a different camera, you just have to make sure the camera's clock is set to the correct local time within a few seconds.


Notes on specific libraries used:
pyexiv2 appears to be a complete pain in the butt to install on mac so I may try and convert to pexif at some point (http://http://code.google.com/p/pexif/) for now, I'm going to keep using pyexiv2. pexif may not currently support very many cameras (including Panasonic) so it might not work out without some additional development.
