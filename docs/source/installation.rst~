Installation
============
Bethic Photo Survey (BPS) runs on Linux, Mac, and Windows operating systems. There are a few different ways to install BPS. You can `download the code`_ from the `bitbucket`_, you can install with the python `pip`_ installer, or you can `git`_ to clone the code from the `bitbucket`_ repository. More details are provided below along with information about software requirements and details specific to installing on different platforms.

Requirements
------------
The following items need to be installed in order for BPS to work. Make sure you read at least to the end of this section before you start installing this stuff. There may be an easier way than installing all these things individually. Then check the section below for your operating system. There may be seperate quirks to the installation process for Windows, Linux, and Mac. I will try to give step-by-step instructions for each operating system below.

1. `Python 2.7`_ BPS may work on older versions of Python but I wouldn't bet on it
2. `GDAL`_ 1.8 or greater 
3. `Matplotlib`_ 1.1.1 or greater, can be installed as part of `SciPy`_ or with PythonXY (see end of this section).
4. `PyQt4`_
5. `pynmea`_ can be installed with `pip`_ by typing ``pip install pynmea`` at the command prompt (or ``sudo pip install pynmea`` if you're on Linux or Mac and need root privileges to install).
6. `pyexiv2`_ has actually been deprecated now. I will eventually rewrite the code to use GExiv2 but, for now, pyexiv2 is required.

That's kind of a lot of stuff to have to install. Fortunately, items 1 - 4 can be taken care of with the `PythonXY`_ installer. `PythonXY`_ is a set of free scientific software tools all bundeled together for easy installation. You can download the `PythonXY`_ installer, run it, make sure that items 1 - 4 are selected, and it will take care of all those steps for you. If you decide later that you want some of the other items to be installed as well, you just run the installer again and check more boxes. It makes things much easier, especially on Windows.


Ways to Get BPS
---------------
There are two different ways to get release versions of BPS and one way to get the latest code from the repository. These are outlines of the steps needed that should be applicable to all operating systems. For a more step-by-step approach, check the OS specfic sections further down the page.

Installing the Latest Release with pip
______________________________________

Go to the command line and type ``pip install BenthicPhotoSurvey``. Depending on your OS, you may need to type ``sudo pip install BenthicPhotoSurvey`` instead and enter your root password.

In order to run BPS, you have to figure out where `pip`_ installed the code and that can vary according to OS and configuration. If you have version of pip >= 1.2.1.post1, you can figure it out by typing ``pip show BenthicPhotoSurvey`` on your command line. The response should contain the location of the ``benthic_photo_survey`` directory. To run BPS, navigate to that directory and start BPS by typing ``python benthic_photo_survey.py`` (on Windows, you'll leave off the ``python`` and just type ``benthic_photo_survey.py``).

On my computer it looks somthing like this::

    blah@blahbidyblah:~$ pip show BenthicPhotoSurvey
    ---
    Name: BenthicPhotoSurvey
    Version: 0.1
    Location: /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages
    Requires: 

So, to launch, I type::

    blah@blahbidyblah:~$ cd /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/benthic_photo_survey
    blah@blahbidyblah:/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/benthic_photo_survey$ python benthic_photo_survey.py

...and the program should run and you can move on to the :doc:`tutorial`. I will, hopefully, get around to packaging BPS a little better so it's easier to launch after installing but this will have to do for now.

Downloading and Installing a Release from bitbucket
___________________________________________________

Use your web browser to `download the code`_ from bitbucket. Unzip that file somewhere. Navigate into the ``benthic_photo_survey`` directory that contains ``benthic_photo_survey.py`` and type ``python benthic_photo_survey.py`` (on Windows, you'll leave off the ``python`` and just type ``benthic_photo_survey.py``).

Getting the Latest Code from bitbucket
______________________________________

First, make sure you have `git`_ installed. Then open the command line where you'd like to put the code and type ``git clone https://jkibele@bitbucket.org/jkibele/benthic_photo_survey.git``. That will download the latest code **which may not be stable**. To run it just follw the instructions from the previous subsection.

Windows
-------

The following steps will demostrate how to install the software required to run BPS, use the `git`_ version control system to download BPS, and then run BPS on Windows.

- Satisify Install Requirements 1 - 4 with PythonXY
    1. Download the latest `PythonXY`_ installer from the `PythonXY Windows Download Page`_.
    #. Run the installer, and make sure that Python2.7.x (currently 2.7.3 but that may change, you just don't want 3.x), GDAL, PyQt4.x, and Matplotlib are selected. You can check whatever additional items you'd like installed as well.
    #. Click through the dialogs to finish the installation process.
- Install `pynmea`_ with pip
    1. Go to the `command prompt`_ and type ``pip install pynmea``. If it installs, then you can move on to the pyexiv2 step below and ignore the sub-steps that follow immediately after this one.
    #. If you get a message that says something about the 'command pip not found', then try typing ``easy_install pip`` at the `command prompt`_. If that doesn't work, you'll need to install `python-distribute`_ and `pip`_ as described in the next sub-step. If it does work (and it installs pip), just go back to the previous sub-step and it should work.
    #. Download the correct installer for your system architecture (32 or 64 bit) from the list of `python-distribute installers`_. We installed python2.7.x so you want the one that matches your system architecture and ends with py2.7.exe. After running that installer, you should be able to type ``easy_install pip`` followed by ``pip install pynmea``. The good news is that python-distribute and pip can be used to install all sorts of useful python stuff and, now that you have them installed, that'll be easy.
- Install pyexiv2
    1. Go to the `pyexiv2 download page`_, scroll down to the Windows section appropriate to your system (32 or 64 bit) and download the latest installer for Python 2.7. Note that the latest versions are at the bottom of the list rather than the top.
    #. Run the installer
- Install `git`_ if you don't already have it
    1. Go to the `git download page`_, download the installer for your system, and run it.
- Use git to get BPS
    1. Open a `command prompt`_ and navigate to a directory where you would like to install BPS
    #. Type ``git clone https://jkibele@bitbucket.org/jkibele/benthic_photo_survey.git``. This will clone the contents of BPS code repository to your computer.
    #. If, after changes have been made to BPS, you want the latest version you can return to a command prompt in this directory and type ``git pull``.

Testing

I will describe how to run the automated tests and how to use the test data that's installed with BPS to make sure everything is working.
