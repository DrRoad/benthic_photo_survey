Introduction
============

Quantitative methods for the derivation of habitat maps from satellite and aerial imagery require reference data (sometimes called ground truth data) to create training sets for supervised classification and for the accuracy assessment of the resulting maps. These data generally need to represent the real world habitat type at many points and, in the case of benthic habitat mapping, the depth at each of those points can also be quite useful. Collecting and processing these data can be a challenging and time consuming task and may be part of the reason that too few benthic habitat mapping studies include adequate accuracy assessment. Benthic Photo Survey (BPS) was created to make this process less painful and, hopefully, make it easier to collect training data and produce an accuracy assessment of the resulting map.

What You Need to use BPS
------------------------

Benthic Photo Survey is designed to work with inexpensive and relatively easy to aquire equipment, partly because that's all that's really required and partly because that's all I can afford. Here's what you'll need:

1. A subersible digital camera that produces jpeg images. I use a `Panasonic Lumix DMC-TS4`_ in an 'Ikelite housing`_ . This camera has a built in compass that records the direction that the camera is faceing when the photo is taken and BPS passes the direction into the shapefile that is created. However, this is not a requirement and any camera that produces jpeg images should be compatable with BPS.
