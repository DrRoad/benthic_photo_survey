Substrate Preferences
=====================

These settings determine which substrate categories are available to tag your images. The 'Add' and 'Remove' buttons should be pretty self explanitory. You can change an item by highlighting the item and clicking on the 'Edit' button or you can simply double click the item. 

Re-ordering
-----------

You can click and drag the items to change their order.
