Habitat Preferences
===================

These settings determine what habitats are available to lable photos with. Each habitat category has an integer code, a label, and a color. You should make sure that all photos within a directory have been tagged using the same settings before you export a shapefile.

Adding a Habitat
----------------

1. Click the 'add' button and see that a new row is created. 
2. Double click the Code cell of the new row and enter a unique integer.
3. Doucle click in the Habitat cell and enter a label for the habitat. Labels will be truncated to 10 characters in the exported shapefile.
4. With the new row still selected, click the 'Choose Color' button and select a color to go with the new habitat category.

The Other Buttons
-----------------

All the other buttons operate on habitat categories in the way you'd expect. 'Remove' will remove a habitat category row. 'Move Up' will move that row up one space. 'Move Down' will completely reformat your hard drive. Just kidding. It'll move the row down.
