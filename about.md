## What Does it Do?

BPS helps you process photo transect data (photos, GPS track, and depth log) into a point shapefile containing habitat and substrate attributes that you assign to each photo using the BPS interface. You can do this without BPS but it will take you a lot longer. Without BPS, you'll have to use several different pieces of software and do hours of mind numbing manual data entry. Previous studies have found this cost in terms of time and money to be a major drawback to the use of photo transects[^1]. 

This is just a brief introduction and overview to the use of BPS. For a more complete look, please look at the [BPS Documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs).


### Step 1: Field Work

BPS works by using the photo acquisition times to find positions and depths in the GPS and (optionally) Depth Logger records. There are number of different ways to use BPS (SCUBA, breath hold diving, drop camera, etc). The only requirement for BPS to work is that the camera be located directly below the GPS and that the depth logger (if being used) is near the seafloor when each photo is taken. The diagram below illustrates the equipment set up for use with SCUBA. Photo transect proceedures have been well documented in previous publications [^1]<sup>,</sup>[^2].
