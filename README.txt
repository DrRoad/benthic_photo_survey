Benthic Photo Survey (BPS) is a software tool (written in Python) that is intended to simplify the task of collecting reference data (sometimes called groundtruth data) for remote sensing of the marine environment. Using a digital camera in a water proof housing, a consumer grade handheld GPS, and (optionally) a depth logger a user can collect data in the field. BPS allows the user to quickly and easily turn this data into a GPS shapefile.

For installation instructions and other information, please see the [Benthic Photo Survey Paper](http://openresearchsoftware.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/jors.104/) in the Journal of Open Research Software and the [Benthic Photo Survey github page](http://jkibele.github.io/benthic_photo_survey/).
